\section{Flight Test Results}

[DARREN/JIM - 1.5 pg]

Describe flight testing setup

Scenarios tested, encounter geometries, good/bad LEC, 400 ft vertical separation

Results obtained for various test scenarios

Lessons learned from the demonstration [DARREN]

- interesting scenarios (table corner case)

- impact of flight plan tracking accuracy on SWC prediction

- changes/improvements for future demos (more dynamic)
