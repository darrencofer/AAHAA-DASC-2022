Our team has flight tested machine learning technology for aircraft collision avoidance with a
run-time assurance architecture designed to guarantee safety in the presence of potential
unintended behaviors.  These capabilities were integrated on Boeing's
Autonomy Testbed Aircraft to show that they can provide correct operation and
safety guarantees needed by real aircraft.  Flight testing demonstrated the ability of the RTA
system to ensure that ``remain well clear'' separation criteria were maintained during a variety of 
collision encounter geometries.  Formal methods and an assurance argument were used to 
provide evidence of the correctness of the RTA design. 

Future work will extend the LEC planner and the RTA architecture to handle multiple intruder 
aircraft and other obstacles such as weather.  We will also update the RTA architecture to 
actively update RWC assessment during a collision encounter and dynamically request
new avoidance plans if safety has been compromised due to change in intruder aircraft behavior 
or the arrival of additional intruders.
