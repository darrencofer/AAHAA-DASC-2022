\section{Autonomy Framework}

[MATT/DENIS - 1.5 pg total]

[MATT/JIM] Overview of the Boeing autonomy framework and aircraft used to demonstrate the collision avoidance neural network capability.

Collision avoidance problem -- Strategic rather than tactical, avoidance flight plan must avoid intruder but return to original flight plan

Limitations --  two-dimensional, lateral avoidance maneuvers, focus on single intruder

Describe the safety requirements for collision avoidance.  Maybe reference DO-365. 

Include picture of test aircraft?

[DENIS/DRAGOS] Reinforcement learning approach and the LEC produced for collision avoidance.  
Produce avoidance trajectory waypoints  by executing LEC repetitively.
